## Clarification on GitHub Issue Usage and Feature Requests

We want to clarify that Github Issues are primarily meant for the purpose of reporting problems or concerns, rather than functioning as an open bug tracker. This means that reported issues on Github may be closed and reported in our internal tracking system or added to our roadmap. 

If you are thinking of requesting a feature, make sure it’s not already part of our upcoming features outlined in the [Roadmap](https://docs.radixdlt.com/docs/roadmap). If you have a feature suggestion, we kindly ask that you share it through [Discord](http://discord.gg/radixdlt) or [Telegram](https://t.me/RadixDevelopers).

Our primary focus is on the priorities outlined in our Roadmap. We appreciate your understanding that addressing reported issues may not always align with our immediate roadmap goals.
