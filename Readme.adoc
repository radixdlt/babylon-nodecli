The command line interface (CLI) provides a collection of tools for below tasks.
It is organized in a hierarchy of subcommands, and each level comes with its own built-in documentation of command syntax and options.

. To interact with node using common API calls
. To setup node quickly on a fresh ubuntu machine using docker compose or systemd
. To setup gateway on a fresh ubuntu machine using docker-compose
. To setup monitoring for the node or gateway.

For complete command reference refer document xref:docs/command_reference.adoc[Command reference]

== Testing with babylon releases

The babylon release is still not public. Therefor testing with babylon will be difficult.
Docker images, version references and binaries can not be fetched without authorization. Because of this, we added this
documentation as a guideline on how to work with babylon.

[source, bash]
----
# This command references https://raw.githubusercontent.com/radixdlt/babylon-nodecli
# It needs access to github in order to load the ansible files. The babylon-nodecli repository is still private.
# So a private access token (PAT) is required. This can be put into the environment variable GITHUB_TOKEN and will then
# be used to fetch the ansible script.
# See here for more information on PAT: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token
export GITHUB_TOKEN="token <YOUR-PAT-HERE>"
/tmp/radixnode docker dependencies


# This command heavily uses latest_version. This function extracts the latest
# version of a resource/repo from github releases. Since the repositories are
# private, fetching the latest version also requires a PAT. See above.


export GITHUB_TOKEN="token <YOUR-PAT-HERE>"
/tmp/radixnode docker config -m CORE

# There is however not a release yet for all resources. So fetching the latest
# version might not always be possible. This is the case for the gateway for
# example. This can be solved by manually overriding the version of these resources.
# Use the below mentioned environment variables for that.
export RADIXDLT_APP_VERSION_OVERRIDE=1.3.1
export RADIXDLT_NGINX_VERSION_OVERRIDE=1.3.3
export RADIXDLT_CLI_VERSION_OVERRIDE=1.3.2
export RADIXDLT_GATEWAY_VERSION_OVERRIDE=1.5.0
/tmp/radixnode docker config -m CORE GATEWAY


# Will try to download ansible playbooks as a resource from a github release at:
# https://raw.githubusercontent.com/radixdlt/babylon-nodecli/<NODE_CLI_VERSION>/node-runner-cli
# Make sure your CLI version is set to a released version of the babylon-nodecli.
# This is done by setting a tag at the current commit before building the binary.
# It will also try to download docker images. As these are not public yet, it is
# mandatory to download the image you are trying to test youself beforehand.
# For this you need to log in to the google registry, download the image and
# then retag it to the expected format. See the example


docker login eu.gcr.io # keeping this secret
docker pull eu.gcr.io/dev-container-repo/babylon-node:pr-247
docker tag eu.gcr.io/dev-container-repo/babylon-node:pr-247 radixdlt/babylon-node:$RADIXDLT_APP_VERSION_OVERRIDE
docker pull radixdlt/babylon-nginx:development-latest
docker tag radixdlt/babylon-nginx:development-latest radixdlt/babylon-nginx:$RADIXDLT_NGINX_VERSION_OVERRIDE

/tmp/radixnode docker install
